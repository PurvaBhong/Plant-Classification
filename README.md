🌱 AgriScan: Plant Disease Classification

A deep learning–powered application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a Streamlit frontend.
AgriScan helps farmers and researchers quickly diagnose crop diseases and take preventive action.

🧠 Model Overview

1. Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Trained on plant disease dataset (PlantVillage or custom dataset)
3. Achieved high accuracy in classifying multiple plant diseases
4. Preprocessing includes:
   Image resizing
   Normalization
   Noise reduction
   Augmentation
